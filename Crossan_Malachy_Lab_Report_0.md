### Goals:
To introduce the modeling, simulation and implementation of digital circuits using  Xilinx's FPGA VIVADO HLx Editions design tools.

### References:
Within the VIVADO, there are several documentation and tutorials that are available. In particular, the “Quick Take Videos” provides basic instructions such as how to create a file using either VHDL or VERILOG. The VIVADO also offers an extensive set of manuals under the Help menu. In addition to the electronic version of the manual and the Quick Sort Tutorial, Xilinx offers many tutorials that are available on the web site at www.xilinx.com.

### Equipment:
The Xilinx's FPGA VIVADO HLx Editions design tools are available in the laboratory. These tools can also be downloaded from Xilinx's web site at www.xilinx.com. The WebPack version of this tool that we use for the laboratory experiments are located under the support download section at the related website https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2017-4.html. Please take note that the file download size exceeds 1 GB and also during the installation process updates may have to be installed. It can take you up to a few hours to download and install the software on your computer. The user does not need to have the BASYS development board interface to the computer to design and simulate an FPGA.

### Pre-laboratory:
Read this experiment carefully to become familiar with the procedural steps in this experiment.

### Discussion:
Xilinx's Vivado is an FPGA design, simulation and implementation tool set that allows the designer the ability to develop digital systems using either schematic capture or HDL using VERILOG or VHDL. These digital systems are then verified using simulation tools that are part of the development system. Once the simulation outputs meet the design requirements, implementation is simply assigning the inputs and outputs to the appropriate pins on the FPGA. Appendix D gives the pin configuration for the BASYS board by Digilent Inc. (www.digilentinc.com) relating the LED and switch connections to the FPGA pin assignments.
